Resources not freed after job failure

Document LPJS_ env vars in RCUG

Save user-specified node states to disk and reload at startup
Add maintenance state that won't be changed to up at compd checkin

Reset job state and node resources for jobs that fail to start due to os err

lpjs restart not working on Linux
systemctl restart lpjs_compd doesn't work
    Waiting a while and running restart again starts the daemon


Later
-----
Support real numbers for pmem, useful when using GB or GiB

Log job stats in a separate accounting log

MPI support

Submission parameter:
    vmem per proc

Add #lpjs concurrent-job-limit

Report peak resource use compared to specified

Optional submission parameters
    has_command, where command is any program in the standard PATH on node
	PATH may differ across compute nodes, as they may run different OSs
    Limit jobs to specific set of nodes, e.g. on high-speed network
	has_feature, specified in config file
	By hostname

Terminate jobs that exceed their resource allocation
    * Only if there are jobs waiting in the queue
	Otherwise, accumulated run time is wasted
    Virtual memory limit checks
	Document that this is enforced by ulimit() and unbreakable
    Real memory limit checks
	Document that this is enforced by periodic sampling

Convert sbatch scripts to lpjs and vice versa
    #lpjs <-> #SBATCH
    LPJS_ARRAY_INDEX <-> SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID
