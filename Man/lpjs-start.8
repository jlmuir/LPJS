.SH DESCRIPTION

lpjs starts lpjs_compd and lpjs_dispatchd, if they are enabled
as system services.  To start and stop these daemons manually,
see lpjs-ad-hoc(8).

Methods for starting system services differ greatly depending
on the operating system.  lpjs start frees the user from these
differences and from typing in complex commands in some cases.

.SH RETURN VALUES

0 upon success, non-zero error codes otherwise
