.SH DESCRIPTION

lpjs restarts lpjs_compd and lpjs_dispatchd, if they are enabled
as system services.  To start and stop these daemons manually,
see lpjs-ad-hoc(8).

Methods for restarting system services differ greatly depending
on the operating system.  lpjs restart frees the user from these
differences and from typing in complex commands in some cases.

.SH RETURN VALUES

0 upon success, non-zero error codes otherwise
