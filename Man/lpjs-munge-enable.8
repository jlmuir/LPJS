.SH DESCRIPTION

lpjs munge-enable is a convenience script for enabling the
munge authentication service.  This process is dependent on
the operating system and the package manager used to install
munge.  lpjs munge-enable eliminates the need to deal with
these differences or to type in lengthy pathnames.

lpjs munge-enable is not generally run directly by the user,
but is used by lpjs-compd-enable(8) and lpjs-dispatchd-enable(8).
